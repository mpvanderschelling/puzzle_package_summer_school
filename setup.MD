Environment setup:
- grid size: $n \times n$
- state: $(p+1, n, n)$ where we have a maximum number of pieces $p$
- action: $n^2$ actions corresponding to placing the piece somewhere in the grid, the first piece moves (for now)
    - alternative: 4 actions for moving piece up/down/left/right and one action for confirm.
